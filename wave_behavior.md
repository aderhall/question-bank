# Wave behavior questions:

1. Two identical pebbles are dropped simultaneously into a perfectly still pond, causing ripples that travel outward at 0.2 ms-1 with a frequency of 20 Hz and amplitude of 0.02 m. 
    1. Explain whether the ripples are longitudinal or transverse waves.
    2. The ripples from both pebbles are emitted in phase. When the ripples from the first pebble reach the second pebble, they completely cancel out. State the name of this phenomenon.
    3. Calculate the wavelength of the ripples.
2. Unpolarized light of wavelength 500 nm and intensity 0.1 Wm-2 passes through a polarizing filter.
    1. Calculate the frequency of the light.
    2. Calculate the intensity of the light after passing through the filter.
    3. The light passes through a second polarizing filter, rotated at an angle of 60° relative to the first filter. Calculate the intensity of light after passing through this filter.
3. The planet Mercury receives sunlight with a peak intensity of 14 kWm-2. It is 47 million kilometers away from the sun. The Earth is 150 million kilometers from the sun.
    1. Calculate the peak intensity of sunlight on Earth. You may ignore the effects of the atmosphere.
    2. Sunlight energy can be converted into electrical energy using photovoltaic cells. A typical photovoltaic cell has an efficiency of 15%. Calculate the power output of a one-square-meter typical photovoltaic cell on Earth in peak sunlight conditions.
    3. In 2018, humans consumed electricity at an average rate of 2.5 terawatts. How much of Earth’s surface area would have to be covered with typical photovoltaic panels to satisfy the global electricity demand during peak sunlight conditions? Give your answer in square kilometers to 3 significant figures.
    4. Calculate the total power output of the sun. Give your answer to 1 significant figure.
4. Unpolarized light passes with an intensity of 64 Wm-2 through a series of 3 polarizers. The second polarizer is rotated at a 30° angle relative to the first polarizer. The third polarizer is rotated at a 90° angle relative to the first polarizer.
    1. Calculate the intensity of light after leaving the third polarizer.
    2. By what factor did the light’s amplitude change from the beginning to the end of the entire process?
    3. What, if anything, will change if the second polarizer is removed?
