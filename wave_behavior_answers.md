1.
    1. Transverse waves, because the oscillation is up and down but the waves travel horizontally (oscillation is perpendicular to direction of energy transfer).
    2. Destructive interference
    3. 0.2 / 20 = 0.01 meters
2.
    1. 3 * 108 / (500 * 10-9) = 6 * 1014 Hz = 600 THz
    2. Intensity decreases by half when unpolarized light passes through a polarizer: 0.05 Wm-2
    3. 0.05 * cos2(60°) = 0.05 * 0.25 = 0.0125 Wm-2
3.
    1. 14,000 Wm-2 / (150/47)2 = 1,374.5 ≈ 1,400 Wm-2
    2. 15% * 1,400 = 210 Wm-2 * 1m2 = 210 W
    3. 2.5 * 1012 / 210 = 1.19 * 1010 m2 = 1.19 * 104 km2 = 11,900 km^2
    4. Power output is surface area * intensity. The total surface area reachable at the Earth’s radius is 4πr^2, so the total power output of the sun is 1400 Wm-2 * 4π(150 billion meters)^2
        
        1400 * 4π(1.5 * 1011)2 = 1.4 * 103 * 4π * 2.25 * 1022 = 39.58 * 1022 = 3.958 * 1023
        
        ≈ 4 * 1023 W = 400 sextillion watts or 400 zettawatts


4.
    1. 64 * 0.5 * cos2(30°) * cos2(60°) = 6 Wm-2
    
        Note: the 0.5 is to account for the unpolarized light being initially polarized and losing half its intensity. The second cos2 takes in 60° instead of 90° because after leaving the first polarizer, the light is already polarized to 30° relative to the original polarizer.
    
    2. Intensity decreased by a factor of 3/32. Amplitude squared is proportional to intensity, so amplitude decreased by a factor of sqrt(3/32) ≈ 0.31.
    
    3. The intensity leaving the third polarizer will be zero, because the light leaving the first polarizer is perpendicular to the third polarizer.
